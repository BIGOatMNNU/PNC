# PNC
Multi-Label Feature Selection via Positive or Negative Correlation

Document Description:

PNCMLFS.m is the PNC algorithm.

dis_efi.m and trans.m are the discrete functions.

mainParameterMyPaper.m is the running function with PNC.

mainMyPaperGroupLabelSpecific.m is the PNC-LGS algorithm.

MLKNN_train and MLKNN_test functions can be found on Zhang Minling's homepage at https://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/ (Resources, Multi-label lazy learning approach).
